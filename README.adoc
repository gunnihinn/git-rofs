= Git ROFS

Git ROFS is a read-only FUSE filesystem for Git repositories. It is more
or less equivalent to a read-only version of `git checkout`, except it
doesn't do any writes to disk.

== Use

The requirements to build the program are:

* `go` >= 1.12
* `libgit2` >= 0.27
* `libfuse`

The Go dependencies use CGo and may require `pkg-config` and a C compiler
as well. To build the program, run:

[source,bash]
----
make
----

To install it to `$prefix` (default `$HOME/bin`):

[source,bash]
----
make install
----

Run the program with:

[source,bash]
----
git-rofs [OPTION]... ROOT MOUNTPOINT
----

`ROOT` is the Git repository to look at. `MOUNTPOINT` is a directory
where the repository should be mounted.

By default, the program will mount the given repository at its current
`HEAD`. This is not very interesting. To mount it at anything that `git
rev-parse` can resolve into a commit hash, use the `-commit REF` option.
